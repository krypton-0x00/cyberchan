              <strong>My Cybersecurity Journey</strong> I initially planned on
              pursuing the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification, but I
              shifted gears towards PJPT due to its practical, hands-on
              approach. With a strong background in Linux and prior experience
              in Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges, I found the PJPT course both
              exciting and challenging. The supportive TCM community, especially
              on Discord, was invaluable, providing guidance and answering even
              the most basic questions with patience and expertise.

              <strong>Achievements and Skills PJPT Certification:</strong> I
              successfully completed my PJPT certification in January 2024,
              excelling in the practical examination which tested my skills in
              internal network penetration testing, Active Directory
              exploitation, and professional report writing. Linux Proficiency:
              With years of experience using and exploring Linux, I have a
              robust understanding of its systems and applications in
              cybersecurity.
